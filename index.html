            <h2>Silent Jungle</h2>
            <p>
                The word jungle came from a Sanskrit word, ‚Äúja·πÖgala‚Äù. It means ‚Äúrough and arid‚Äù. 
                A jungle may be land or area with a particularly dense quantity of vegetation. 
                This dense forest of vegetation includes several trees and plants found in tropical climates. 
                They're also home to high biodiversity and many unique species but are also some of the most 
                fragile ecosystems on Earth. A jungle appears overgrown and is sometimes in a particularly hot
                 part of the world with loads of rainfall. 
                <br><br>

                Jungle may be a  forest thick with trees, different plants, and animals. 
                Jungles are a little dangerous; that is what people mean once they say, 
                "It's a jungle out there!" Jungles are thick tropical forests full of life, such as birds, 
                insects, reptiles, monkeys, and often gorillas and other animals. 
                The jungle is far-famed for its thick forests and massive amounts of plants and vines. 
                whereas they need loads in common with rainforests, they're not a constant issue. 
                Rainforests have very thick canopies of trees, so their floor is blocked from the sun.
                On the other hand, jungles enable additional light from the sun, so they let different 
                plants grow. This additional lightweight helps the plants and trees grow so much that it 
                becomes troublesome to manoeuvre around in a jungle.
                <br><br>

                Jungles are found everywhere across the world, sometimes surrounding rainforests that have 
                grown. The foremost renowned jungles in the world can be found in Central America and South 
                America; however, they're settled in different areas, as well. Because they have heat 
                environments with hot and wet temperatures, jungle are generally found close to the equator.
                Some of the foremost common types of trees found within the jungle are the Brazil-nut tree, 
                palm trees, and even vines, moss and ferns that only grow on other trees, called epiphytes. 
                Because the jungle is already such a harsh environment for plants, they can't afford to be 
                attacked or ingested by animals, too. Many varieties of plants have been tailored to remove 
                toxins if animals ought to come back by victimising them to guard themselves against danger.
